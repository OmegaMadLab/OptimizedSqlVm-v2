#### Error messages

##### Error: The parameter is incorrect (HRESULT:-2147024809)

This is for example caused by trying to add an URL with the wrong format
i.e. 'htp://+:80'.

##### Error: The Url has already been reserved (HRESULT:-2147220932)

This is caused when the URL is already reserved. For example when 'http://+:80'
already exist.

##### Error: Cannot create a file when that file already exists (HRESULT:-2147024713)

This is caused when trying to add another URL using the same protocol. For example
when trying to add 'http://+:443' when 'http://+:80' already exist.

### SqlScript

Provides the means to run a user generated T-SQL script on the SQL Server instance.
Three scripts are required; Get T-SQL script, Set T-SQL script and the Test T-SQL
script.

#### Scripts

##### Get T-SQL Script (GetFilePath)

The Get T-SQL script is used to query the status when running the cmdlet
Get-DscConfiguration, and the result can be found in the property `GetResult`.

##### Test T-SQL Script (TestFilePath)

The Test T-SQL script is used to test if the desired state is met. If Test
T-SQL raises an error or returns any value other than 'null' the test fails, thus
the Set T-SQL script is run.

##### Set T-SQL Script (SetFilePath)

The Set T-SQL script performs the actual change when Test T-SQL script fails.

#### Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
* Target machine must be running SQL Server 2008 or later.
* Target machine must have access to the SQLPS PowerShell module or the SqlServer
  PowerShell module.

_Note: There is a known problem running this resource using PowerShell 4.0.
See [issue #273](https://github.com/PowerShell/SqlServerDsc/issues/273)
for more information._

#### Parameters

* **`[String]` ServerInstance** _(Key)_: The name of an instance of the Database
  Engine. For a default instance, only specify the computer name. For a named

* **`[String]` SetFilePath** _(Key)_: Path to the T-SQL file that will perform Set
  action.
* **`[String]` GetFilePath** _(Key)_: Path to the T-SQL file that will perform Get
  action. Any values returned by the T-SQL queries will also be returned by the
  cmdlet Get-DscConfiguration through the `GetResult` property.
* **`[String]` TestFilePath** _(Key)_: Path to the T-SQL file that will perform Test
  action. Any script that does not throw an error or returns null is evaluated to
  true. The cmdlet Invoke-Sqlcmd treats T-SQL Print statements as verbose text,
  and will not cause the test to return false.
* **`[PSCredential]` Credential** _(Write)_: The credentials to authenticate with,
  using SQL Authentication. To authenticate using Windows Authentication, assign
  the credentials to the built-in parameter `PsDscRunAsCredential`. If both parameters
  `Credential` and `PsDscRunAsCredential` are not assigned, then SYSTEM account will
  be used to authenticate using Windows Authentication.
* **`[UInt32]` QueryTimeout** _(Write)_: Specifies, as an integer, the number of
  seconds after which the T-SQL script execution will time out.  In some SQL Server
  versions there is a bug in Invoke-Sqlcmd where the normal default value 0 (no
  timeout) is not respected and the default value is incorrectly set to 30 seconds.
* **`[String[]]` Variable** _(Write)_: Specifies, as a string array, a scripting
  variable for use in the sql script, and sets a value for the variable. Use a
  Windows PowerShell array to specify multiple variables and their values. For more
  information how to use this, please go to the help documentation for [Invoke-Sqlcmd](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt683370.aspx).

### SqlServerMaxDop

This resource set the max degree of parallelism server configuration option.
The max degree of parallelism option is used to limit the number of processors to
use in parallel plan execution.
Read more about max degree of parallelism in this article
[Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189094.aspx)

#### Formula for dynamically allocating max degree of parallelism

* If the number of configured NUMA nodes configured in SQL Server equals 1, then
  max degree of parallelism is calculated using number of cores divided in 2
  (numberOfCores / 2), then rounded up to the next integer (3.5 > 4).
* If the number of cores configured in SQL Server are greater than or equal to
  8 cores then max degree of parallelism will be set to 8.
* If the number of configured NUMA nodes configured in SQL Server is greater than
  2 and the number of cores are less than 8 then max degree of parallelism will
  be set to the number of cores.

#### Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
* Target machine must be running SQL Server Database Engine 2008 or later.

#### Parameters

* **`[String]` InstanceName** (Key): The name of the SQL instance to be configured.
* **`[String]` ServerName** _(Write)_: The host name of the SQL Server to be configured.
  Default value is $env:COMPUTERNAME.
* **`[String]` Ensure** _(Write)_: When set to 'Present' then max degree of parallelism
  will be set to either the value in parameter MaxDop or dynamically configured
  when parameter DynamicAlloc is set to $true. When set to 'Absent' max degree of
  parallelism will be set to 0 which means no limit in number of processors used
  in parallel plan execution. { *Present* | Absent }.
* **`[Boolean]` DynamicAlloc** _(Write)_: If set to $true then max degree of parallelism
  will be dynamically configured. When this is set parameter is set to $true, the
  parameter MaxDop must be set to $null or not be configured.

### SqlServerMemory

This resource sets the minimum server memory and maximum server memory configuration
option.
That means it sets the minimum and the maximum amount of memory, in MB, in the buffer
pool used by the instance of SQL Server
The default setting for minimum server memory is 0, and the default setting for
maximum server memory is 2147483647 MB.
Read more about minimum server memory and maximum server memory in this article
[Server Memory Server Configuration Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178067.aspx).

#### Formula for dynamically allocating maximum memory

The formula is based on the [SQL Max Memory Calculator](http://sqlmax.chuvash.eu/)
website. The website code is in the sql-max GitHub repository maintained by [@mirontoli](https://github.com/mirontoli).
The dynamic maximum memory (in MB) is calculate with this formula:
SQL Max Memory = TotalPhysicalMemory - (NumOfSQLThreads\*ThreadStackSize) -
(1024\*CEILING(NumOfCores/4)) - OSReservedMemory.

##### NumOfSQLThreads

* If the number of cores is less than or equal to 4, the number of SQL threads
  is set to: 256 + (NumberOfCores - 4) \* 8.
* If the number of cores is greater than 4, the number of SQL threads is set
  to: 0 (zero).

##### ThreadStackSize

* If the architecture of windows server is x86, the size of thread stack is 1MB.
* If the architecture of windows server is x64, the size of thread stack is 2MB.
* If the architecture of windows server is IA64, the size of thread stack is 4MB.

##### OSReservedMemory

* If the total physical memory is less than or equal to 20GB, the percentage of
  reserved memory for OS is 20% of total physical memory.
* If the total physical memory is greater than 20GB, the percentage of reserved
  memory for OS is 12.5% of total physical memory.

#### Requirements

* Target machine must be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.
* Target machine must be running SQL Server Database Engine 2008 or later.
